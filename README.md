# Super-Space-Defense


Welcome to this repository! Unfortunately, you will have to follow the hacker's guide, until I find out how to add executables made in Python onto a repository.

Users on mac, please try using the Linux steps.

If you encounter any bugs, feel free to mention it in the _Issues_ page, or, if you have a suggestion that makes this better, you can make a pull request!

# HACKER'S GUIDE

If you are using the Windows OS (Operating System):
1. Download the .py file. DO NOT RENAME IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
2. Install Visual Studio Code. You can install another IDLE or IDE, but I find Visual Studio Code easier to navigate. Visual Studio Code is a free IDE.
3. Get Python (either the extension or from somewhere else)
4. Get the module Pygame (in command prompt, type in *pip install pygame*)
5. To run the game without making it an executable, run it in your IDLE or IDE
6. (Optional) Make your edits and modifications.
7. (Optional) Get Pyinstaller (pip install pyinstaller)
8. (Optional) In the command prompt, type in "pyinstaller (directory path)\SuperSpaceDefense.py --onefile"
9. (Optional) After a while, go to the folder where you put the file *SuperSpaceDefense.py* and then go to dist. Then open the file inside and start playing!

If you are using the Linux OS (Operating System):
1. Download the .py file. DO NOT RENAME IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
2. Install Visual Studio Code. You can install another IDLE or IDE, or use your text editor, but I find Visual Studio Code easier to navigate. Visual Studio Code is a free IDE.
3. Get Python (type in *sudo apt install python* in the terminal, or ctrl-alt-t)
4. Get the module pygame (in terminal, type in *pip3 install pygame*)
5. To run the game without making it an executable, run it in your IDLE or IDE
6. (Optional) Make your edits and modifications.
7. (Optional) Get Pyinstaller (pip3 install pyinstaller)
8. (Optional) In the command prompt, type in "pyinstaller (directory path)/SuperSpaceDefense.py --onefile
9. (Optional) After a while, go to the folder where you put the file *SuperSpaceDefense.py* and then go to dist. Then open the file inside and start playing!
10. (Step 8 needs to be done) If you encounter issues about not being able to open the file, copy the directory, go to terminal, then type in *cd (paste the directory here)*, then type in *chmod +x SuperSpaceDefense*, then type in *./SuperSpaceDefense*
